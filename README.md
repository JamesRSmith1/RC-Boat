**Custom 3D Printed Remote Controlled Boat Project**

A 4.5"x11.5" Custom 3D Printed RC Boat using a water jet pump.

**Why**

After taking some inspiration from a friend creating their own RC Fan Boat, I wanted to dip my toes into the RC world through making my own. I figured that an RC Boat would be a relatively easier, yet still challenging, project to start working with RC and making my own things. In the future, I will hope to make a custom 5" FPV Drone as I enjoy flying my current TinyWhoop.
I used to have a fast RC Speedboat and would take it out to the lake to drive around whenever I could. I would like to try and bring this boat as I used to and try it out.
